[Random Number Generator][1]
=================

A very simple app that will provide random numbers between any two start and end numbers.

Great for simulating dice, or rng, or for any other time you need a random number!

Uses Java's Random class (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Random.html) and nextInt(int) method to generate the numbers, if you are interested in what the app uses to generate these numbers. A fresh Random class is generated on each button press, so the same seed is not used twice.
